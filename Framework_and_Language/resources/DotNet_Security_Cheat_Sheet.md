# DotNet Security Cheat Sheet
## Introduction
This page intends to provide quick basic .NET security tips for developers.
### The .NET Framework
The .NET Framework is Microsoft's principal platform for enterprise
development. It is the supporting API for ASP.NET, Windows Desktop
applications, Windows Communication Foundation services, SharePoint, Visual
Studio Tools for Office and other technologies.
The .NET Framework constitutes a collection of APIs that facilitate the usage
of an advanced type system, managing data, graphics, networking, file
operations, and more - essentially covering the vast majority of requirements
for developing enterprise applications within the Microsoft ecosystem. It is a
nearly ubiquitous library that is strongly named and versioned at the assembly
level.
### Updating the Framework
The .NET Framework is kept up-to-date by Microsoft with the Windows Update
service. Developers do not normally need to run separate updates to the
Framework. Windows Update can be accessed at Windows_Update or from the Windows
Update program on a Windows computer.
Individual frameworks can be kept up to date using NuGet. As Visual Studio
prompts for updates, build it into your lifecycle.
Remember that third-party libraries have to be updated separately and not all
of them use NuGet. ELMAH for instance, requires a separate update effort.
### Security Announcements
Receive security notifications by selecting the "Watch" button at the following
repositories:
    * .NET_Core_Security_Announcements
    * ASP.NET_Core_&_Entity_Framework_Core_Security_Announcements
## .NET General Guidance
This section contains general guidance for .NET applications. This applies to
all .NET applications, including ASP.NET, WPF, WinForms, and others.
The OWASP Top 10 lists the most prevalent and dangerous threats to web security
in the world today and is reviewed every few years and updated with the latest
threat data. This section of the cheat sheet is based on this list. Your
approach to securing your web application should be to start at the top threat
A1 below and work down; this will ensure that any time spent on security will
be spent most effectively and cover the top threats first and lesser threats
afterwards. After covering the Top 10 it is generally advisable to assess for
other threats or get a professionally completed Penetration Test.
### A01 Broken Access Control
#### Weak Account management
Ensure cookies are sent with the HttpOnly flag set to prevent client side
scripts from accessing the cookie:
CookieHttpOnly = true,
Reduce the time period a session can be stolen in by reducing session timeout
and removing sliding expiration:
The decision to use sliding expiration depends on your application's threat
model. Setting SlidingExpiration to false enforces an absolute session
lifetime, which limits how long a stolen session can be reused, at the cost of
reduced usability for long-lived interactive sessions. For some applications,
enabling sliding expiration (true) may be preferred for user experience, as it
keeps the session alive as long as the user is active. This convenience comes
with increased risk if a session is compromised.
ExpireTimeSpan = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(60),
SlidingExpiration = false
See here for an example of a full startup code snippet.
Ensure cookies are sent over HTTPS in production. This should be enforced in
the config transforms:
<httpCookies requireSSL="true" />
<authentication>
    <forms requireSSL="true" />
</authentication>
Protect LogOn, Registration and password reset methods against brute force
attacks by throttling requests (see code below). Consider also using ReCaptcha.
[HttpPost]
[AllowAnonymous]
[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
[AllowXRequestsEveryXSecondsAttribute(Name = "LogOn",
Message = "You have performed this action more than {x} times in the last {n}
seconds.",
Requests = 3, Seconds = 60)]
public async Task<ActionResult> LogOn(LogOnViewModel model, string returnUrl)
DO NOT: Roll your own authentication or session management. Use the one
provided by .NET.
DO NOT: Tell someone if the account exists on LogOn, Registration or Password
reset. Say something like 'Either the username or password was incorrect', or
'If this account exists then a reset token will be sent to the registered email
address'. This protects against account enumeration.
The feedback to the user should be identical whether or not the account exists,
both in terms of content and behavior. E.g., if the response takes 50% longer
when the account is real then membership information can be guessed and tested.
#### Missing function-level access control
DO: Authorize users on all externally facing endpoints. The .NET framework has
many ways to authorize a user, use them at method level:
[Authorize(Roles = "Admin")]
[HttpGet]
public ActionResult Index(int page = 1)
or better yet, at controller level:
[Authorize]
public class UserController
You can also check roles in code using identity features in .net:
System.Web.Security.Roles.IsUserInRole(userName, roleName)
You can find more information in the Authorization_Cheat_Sheet and
Authorization_Testing_Automation_Cheat_Sheet.
#### Insecure Direct object references
When you have a resource (object) which can be accessed by a reference (in the
sample below this is the id), you need to ensure that the user is intended to
have access to that resource.
// Insecure
public ActionResult Edit(int id)
{
  var user = _context.Users.FirstOrDefault(e => e.Id == id);
  return View("Details", new UserViewModel(user);
}

// Secure
public ActionResult Edit(int id)
{
  var user = _context.Users.FirstOrDefault(e => e.Id == id);
  // Establish user has right to edit the details
  if (user.Id != _userIdentity.GetUserId())
  {
        HandleErrorInfo error = new HandleErrorInfo(
            new Exception("INFO:
 You do not have permission to edit these details"));
        return View("Error", error);
  }
  return View("Edit", new UserViewModel(user);
}
More information can be found in the Insecure_Direct_Object_Reference
Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.
### A02 Cryptographic Failures
#### General cryptography guidance
    * Never, ever write your own cryptographic functions.
    * Wherever possible, try and avoid writing any cryptographic code at all.
      Instead try and either use pre-existing secrets management solutions or
      the secret management solution provided by your cloud provider. For more
      information, see the OWASP_Secrets_Management_Cheat_Sheet.
    * If you cannot use a pre-existing secrets management solution, try and use
      a trusted and well known implementation library rather than using the
      libraries built into .NET as it is far too easy to make cryptographic
      errors with them.
    * Make sure your application or protocol can easily support a future change
      of cryptographic algorithms.
#### Hashing
DO: Use a strong hashing algorithm.
    * In .NET (both Framework and Core), the strongest hashing algorithm for
      general hashing requirements is System.Security.Cryptography.SHA512.
    * In .NET Framework 4.6 and earlier, the strongest algorithm for password
      hashing is PBKDF2, implemented as
      System.Security.Cryptography.Rfc2898DeriveBytes.
    * In .NET Framework 4.6.1 and later and .NET Core, the strongest algorithm
      for password hashing is PBKDF2, implemented as
      Microsoft.AspNetCore.Cryptography.KeyDerivation.Pbkdf2 which has several
      significant advantages over Rfc2898DeriveBytes.
    * When using a hashing function to hash non-unique inputs such as
      passwords, use a salt value added to the original value before hashing.
    * Refer to the Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet for more information.
#### Passwords
DO: Enforce passwords with a minimum complexity that will survive a dictionary
attack; i.e. longer passwords that use the full character set (numbers, symbols
and letters) to increase entropy.
#### Encryption
DO: Use a strong encryption algorithm such as AES-512 where personally
identifiable data needs to be restored to it's original format.
DO: Protect encryption keys more than any other asset. Find more information
about storing encryption keys at rest in the Key_Management_Cheat_Sheet.
DO: Use TLS 1.2+ for your entire site. Get a free certificate LetsEncrypt.org
and automate renewals.
DO NOT: Allow_SSL,_this_is_now_obsolete.
DO: Have a strong TLS policy (see SSL_Best_Practices), use TLS 1.2+ wherever
possible. Then check the configuration using SSL_Test or TestSSL.
More information on Transport Layer Protection can be found in the Transport
Layer_Security_Cheat_Sheet.
DO: Ensure headers are not disclosing information about your application. See
HttpHeaders.cs, Dionach_StripHeaders, disable via web.config or Startup.cs.
e.g Web.config
<system.web>
    <httpRuntime enableVersionHeader="false"/>
</system.web>
<system.webServer>
    <security>
        <requestFiltering removeServerHeader="true" />
    </security>
    <httpProtocol>
        <customHeaders>
            <add name="X-Content-Type-Options" value="nosniff" />
            <add name="X-Frame-Options" value="DENY" />
            <add name="X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies" value="master-only"/>
            <add name="X-XSS-Protection" value="0"/>
            <remove name="X-Powered-By"/>
        </customHeaders>
    </httpProtocol>
</system.webServer>
e.g Startup.cs
app.UseHsts(hsts => hsts.MaxAge(365).IncludeSubdomains());
app.UseXContentTypeOptions();
app.UseReferrerPolicy(opts => opts.NoReferrer());
app.UseXXssProtection(options => options.FilterDisabled());
app.UseXfo(options => options.Deny());

app.UseCsp(opts => opts
 .BlockAllMixedContent()
 .StyleSources(s => s.Self())
 .StyleSources(s => s.UnsafeInline())
 .FontSources(s => s.Self())
 .FormActions(s => s.Self())
 .FrameAncestors(s => s.Self())
 .ImageSources(s => s.Self())
 .ScriptSources(s => s.Self())
 );
More information about headers can be found at the OWASP_Secure_Headers
Project.
#### Encryption for storage
    * Use the Windows_Data_Protection_API_(DPAPI) for secure local storage of
      sensitive data.
    * Where DPAPI cannot be used, follow the algorithm guidance in the OWASP
      Cryptographic_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.
The following code snippet shows an example of using AES-GCM to perform
encryption/decryption of data. It is strongly recommended to have a
cryptography expert review your final design and code, as even the most trivial
error can severely weaken your encryption.
The code is based on example from here: https://www.scottbrady91.com/c-sharp/
aes-gcm-dotnet
A few constraints/pitfalls with this code:
    * It does not take into account key rotation or management which is a whole
      topic in itself.
    * It is important to use a different nonce for every encryption operation,
      even if the same key is used.
    * The key will need to be stored securely.

// Code based on example from here:
// https://www.scottbrady91.com/c-sharp/aes-gcm-dotnet

public class AesGcmSimpleTest
{
    public static void Main()
    {

        // Key of 32 bytes / 256 bits for AES
        var key = new byte[32];
        RandomNumberGenerator.Fill(key);

        // MaxSize = 12 bytes / 96 bits and this size should always be used.
        var nonce = new byte[AesGcm.NonceByteSizes.MaxSize];
        RandomNumberGenerator.Fill(nonce);

        // Tag for authenticated encryption
        var tag = new byte[AesGcm.TagByteSizes.MaxSize];

        var message = "This message to be encrypted";
        Console.WriteLine(message);

        // Encrypt the message
        var cipherText = AesGcmSimple.Encrypt(message, nonce, out tag, key);
        Console.WriteLine(Convert.ToBase64String(cipherText));

        // Decrypt the message
        var message2 = AesGcmSimple.Decrypt(cipherText, nonce, tag, key);
        Console.WriteLine(message2);


    }
}


public static class AesGcmSimple
{

    public static byte[] Encrypt(string plaintext, byte[] nonce, out byte[]
tag, byte[] key)
    {
        using(var aes = new AesGcm(key))
        {
            // Tag for authenticated encryption
            tag = new byte[AesGcm.TagByteSizes.MaxSize];

            // Create a byte array from the message to encrypt
            var plaintextBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(plaintext);

            // Ciphertext will be same length in bytes as plaintext
            var ciphertext = new byte[plaintextBytes.Length];

            // perform the actual encryption
            aes.Encrypt(nonce, plaintextBytes, ciphertext, tag);
            return ciphertext;
        }
    }

    public static string Decrypt(byte[] ciphertext, byte[] nonce, byte[] tag,
byte[] key)
    {
        using(var aes = new AesGcm(key))
        {
            // Plaintext will be same length in bytes as Ciphertext
            var plaintextBytes = new byte[ciphertext.Length];

            // perform the actual decryption
            aes.Decrypt(nonce, ciphertext, tag, plaintextBytes);

            return Encoding.UTF8.GetString(plaintextBytes);
        }
    }
}
#### Encryption for transmission
    * Again, follow the algorithm guidance in the OWASP_Cryptographic_Storage
      Cheat_Sheet.
The following code snippet shows an example of using Elliptic Curve/Diffie-
Hellman (ECDH) together with AES-GCM to perform encryption/decryption of data
between two different sides without the need to transfer the symmetric key
between the two sides. Instead, the sides exchange public keys and can then use
ECDH to generate a shared secret which can be used for the symmetric
encryption.
Again, it is strongly recommended to have a cryptography expert review your
final design and code, as even the most trivial error can severely weaken your
encryption.
Note that this code sample relies on the AesGcmSimple class from the previous
section.
A few constraints/pitfalls with this code:
    * It does not take into account key rotation or management which is a whole
      topic in itself.
    * The code deliberately enforces a new nonce for every encryption operation
      but this must be managed as a separate data item alongside the
      ciphertext.
    * The private keys will need to be stored securely.
    * The code does not consider the validation of public keys before use.
    * Overall, there is no verification of authenticity between the two sides.

public class ECDHSimpleTest
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        // Generate ECC key pair for Alice
        var alice = new ECDHSimple();
        byte[] alicePublicKey = alice.PublicKey;

        // Generate ECC key pair for Bob
        var bob = new ECDHSimple();
        byte[] bobPublicKey = bob.PublicKey;

        string plaintext = "Hello, Bob! How are you?";
        Console.WriteLine("Secret being sent from Alice to Bob: " + plaintext);

        // Note that a new nonce is generated with every encryption operation
in line with
        // in line with the AES GCM security
        byte[] tag;
        byte[] nonce;
        var cipherText = alice.Encrypt(bobPublicKey, plaintext, out nonce, out
tag);
        Console.WriteLine("Ciphertext, nonce, and tag being sent from Alice to
Bob: " + Convert.ToBase64String(cipherText) + " " + Convert.ToBase64String
(nonce) + " " + Convert.ToBase64String(tag));

        var decrypted = bob.Decrypt(alicePublicKey, cipherText, nonce, tag);
        Console.WriteLine("Secret received by Bob from Alice: " + decrypted);

        Console.WriteLine();

        string plaintext2 = "Hello, Alice! I'm good, how are you?";
        Console.WriteLine("Secret being sent from Bob to Alice: " +
plaintext2);

        byte[] tag2;
        byte[] nonce2;
        var cipherText2 = bob.Encrypt(alicePublicKey, plaintext2, out nonce2,
out tag2);
        Console.WriteLine("Ciphertext, nonce, and tag being sent from Bob to
Alice: " + Convert.ToBase64String(cipherText2) + " " + Convert.ToBase64String
(nonce2) + " " + Convert.ToBase64String(tag2));

        var decrypted2 = alice.Decrypt(bobPublicKey, cipherText2, nonce2,
tag2);
        Console.WriteLine("Secret received by Alice from Bob: " + decrypted2);
    }
}


public class ECDHSimple
{

    private ECDiffieHellmanCng ecdh = new ECDiffieHellmanCng();

    public byte[] PublicKey
    {
        get
        {
            return ecdh.PublicKey.ToByteArray();
        }
    }

    public byte[] Encrypt(byte[] partnerPublicKey, string message, out byte[]
nonce, out byte[] tag)
    {
        // Generate the AES Key and Nonce
        var aesKey = GenerateAESKey(partnerPublicKey);

        // Tag for authenticated encryption
        tag = new byte[AesGcm.TagByteSizes.MaxSize];

        // MaxSize = 12 bytes / 96 bits and this size should always be used.
        // A new nonce is generated with every encryption operation in line
with
        // the AES GCM security model
        nonce = new byte[AesGcm.NonceByteSizes.MaxSize];
        RandomNumberGenerator.Fill(nonce);

        // return the encrypted value
        return AesGcmSimple.Encrypt(message, nonce, out tag, aesKey);
    }


    public string Decrypt(byte[] partnerPublicKey, byte[] ciphertext, byte[]
nonce, byte[] tag)
    {
        // Generate the AES Key and Nonce
        var aesKey = GenerateAESKey(partnerPublicKey);

        // return the decrypted value
        return AesGcmSimple.Decrypt(ciphertext, nonce, tag, aesKey);
    }

    private byte[] GenerateAESKey(byte[] partnerPublicKey)
    {
        // Derive the secret based on this side's private key and the other
side's public key
        byte[] secret = ecdh.DeriveKeyMaterial(CngKey.Import(partnerPublicKey,
CngKeyBlobFormat.EccPublicBlob));

        byte[] aesKey = new byte[32]; // 256-bit AES key
        Array.Copy(secret, 0, aesKey, 0, 32); // Copy first 32 bytes as the key

        return aesKey;
    }
}
### A03 Injection
#### SQL Injection
DO: Using an object relational mapper (ORM) or stored procedures is the most
effective way of countering the SQL Injection vulnerability.
DO: Use parameterized queries where a direct SQL query must be used. More
Information can be found in the Query_Parameterization_Cheat_Sheet.
E.g., using Entity Framework:
var sql = @"Update [User] SET FirstName = @FirstName WHERE Id = @Id";
context.Database.ExecuteSqlCommand(
    sql,
    new SqlParameter("@FirstName", firstname),
    new SqlParameter("@Id", id));
DO NOT: Concatenate strings anywhere in your code and execute them against your
database (Known as dynamic SQL).
Note: You can still accidentally do this with ORMs or Stored procedures so
check everywhere. For example:
string sql = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserName='" + txtUser.Text + "' AND Password='"
                + txtPassword.Text + "'";
context.Database.ExecuteSqlCommand(sql); // SQL Injection vulnerability!
DO: Practice Least Privilege - connect to the database using an account with a
minimum set of permissions required to do its job, not the database
administrator account.
#### OS Injection
General guidance about OS Injection can be found in the OS_Command_Injection
Defense_Cheat_Sheet.
DO: Use System.Diagnostics.Process.Start to call underlying OS functions.
e.g
var process = new System.Diagnostics.Process();
var startInfo = new System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo();
startInfo.FileName = "validatedCommand";
startInfo.Arguments = "validatedArg1 validatedArg2 validatedArg3";
process.StartInfo = startInfo;
process.Start();
DO NOT: Assume that this mechanism will protect against malicious input
designed to break out of one argument and then tamper with another argument to
the process. This will still be possible.
DO: Use allowlist validation on all user supplied input wherever possible.
Input validation prevents improperly formed data from entering an information
system. For more information please see the Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.
e.g Validating user input using IPAddress.TryParse_Method
//User input
string ipAddress = "127.0.0.1";

//check to make sure an ip address was provided
if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(ipAddress))
{
 // Create an instance of IPAddress for the specified address string (in
 // dotted-quad, or colon-hexadecimal notation).
 if (IPAddress.TryParse(ipAddress, out var address))
 {
  // Display the address in standard notation.
  return address.ToString();
 }
 else
 {
  //ipAddress is not of type IPAddress
  ...
 }
    ...
}
DO: Try to only accept characters which are simple alphanumeric.
DO NOT: Assume you can sanitize special characters without actually removing
them. Various combinations of \, ' and @ may have an unexpected impact on
sanitization attempts.
DO NOT: Rely on methods without a security guarantee.
e.g. .NET Core 2.2 and greater and .NET 5 and greater support
ProcessStartInfo.ArgumentList which performs some character escaping but the
object includes a_disclaimer_that_it_is_not_safe_with_untrusted_input.
DO: Look at alternatives to passing raw untrusted arguments via command-line
parameters such as encoding using Base64 (which would safely encode any special
characters as well) and then decode the parameters in the receiving
application.
#### LDAP injection
Almost any characters can be used in Distinguished Names. However, some must be
escaped with the backslash \ escape character. A table showing which characters
that should be escaped for Active Directory can be found at the in the LDAP
Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.
Note: The space character must be escaped only if it is the leading or trailing
character in a component name, such as a Common Name. Embedded spaces should
not be escaped.
More information can be found in the LDAP_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.
### A04 Insecure Design
Insecure design refers to security failures in the design of the application or
system. This is different than the other items in the OWASP Top 10 list which
refer to implementation failures. The topic of secure design is therefore not
related to a specific technology or language and is therefore out of scope for
this cheat sheet. See the Secure_Product_Design_Cheat_Sheet for more
information.
### A05 Security Misconfiguration
#### Debug and Stack Trace
Ensure debug and trace are off in production. This can be enforced using
web.config transforms:
<compilation xdt:Transform="RemoveAttributes(debug)" />
<trace enabled="false" xdt:Transform="Replace"/>
DO NOT: Use default passwords
DO: Redirect a request made over HTTP to HTTPS:
E.g, Global.asax.cs:
protected void Application_BeginRequest()
{
    #if !DEBUG
    // SECURE: Ensure any request is returned over SSL/TLS in production
    if (!Request.IsLocal && !Context.Request.IsSecureConnection) {
        var redirect = Context.Request.Url.ToString()
                        .ToLower(CultureInfo.CurrentCulture)
                        .Replace("http:", "https:");
        Response.Redirect(redirect);
    }
    #endif
}
E.g., Startup.cs in Configure():
  app.UseHttpsRedirection();
#### Cross-site request forgery
DO NOT: Send sensitive data without validating Anti-Forgery-Tokens (.NET / .NET
Core).
DO: Send the anti-forgery token with every POST/PUT request:
##### Using .NET Framework
using (Html.BeginForm("LogOff", "Account", FormMethod.Post, new { id =
"logoutForm",
                        @class = "pull-right" }))
{
    @Html.AntiForgeryToken()
    <ul class="nav nav-pills">
        <li role="presentation">
        Logged on as @User.Identity.Name
        </li>
        <li role="presentation">
        <a href="javascript:document.getElementById('logoutForm').submit()">Log
off</a>
        </li>
    </ul>
}
Then validate it at the method or preferably the controller level:
[HttpPost]
[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
public ActionResult LogOff()
Make sure the tokens are removed completely for invalidation on logout.
/// <summary>
/// SECURE: Remove any remaining cookies including Anti-CSRF cookie
/// </summary>
public void RemoveAntiForgeryCookie(Controller controller)
{
    string[] allCookies = controller.Request.Cookies.AllKeys;
    foreach (string cookie in allCookies)
    {
        if (controller.Response.Cookies[cookie] != null &&
            cookie == "__RequestVerificationToken")
        {
            controller.Response.Cookies[cookie].Expires = DateTime.Now.AddDays
(-1);
        }
    }
}
##### Using .NET Core 2.0 or later
Starting with .NET Core 2.0 it is possible to automatically_generate_and_verify
the_antiforgery_token.
If you are using tag-helpers, which is the default for most web project
templates, then all forms will automatically send the anti-forgery token. You
can check if tag-helpers are enabled by checking if your main _
ViewImports.cshtml file contains:
@addTagHelper *, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers
IHtmlHelper.BeginForm also sends anti-forgery-tokens automatically.
If you are not using tag-helpers or IHtmlHelper.BeginForm, you must use the
requisite helper on forms as seen here:
<form action="RelevantAction" >
@Html.AntiForgeryToken()
</form>
To automatically validate all requests other than GET, HEAD, OPTIONS and TRACE
you need to add a global action filter with the AutoValidateAntiforgeryToken
attribute inside your Startup.cs as mentioned in the following article:
services.AddMvc(options =>
{
    options.Filters.Add(new AutoValidateAntiforgeryTokenAttribute());
});
If you need to disable the attribute validation for a specific method on a
controller you can add the IgnoreAntiforgeryToken attribute to the controller
method (for MVC controllers) or parent class (for Razor pages):
[IgnoreAntiforgeryToken]
[HttpDelete]
public IActionResult Delete()
[IgnoreAntiforgeryToken]
public class UnsafeModel : PageModel
If you need to also validate the token on GET, HEAD, OPTIONS and TRACE requests
you can add the ValidateAntiforgeryToken attribute to the controller method
(for MVC controllers) or parent class (for Razor pages):
[HttpGet]
[ValidateAntiforgeryToken]
public IActionResult DoSomethingDangerous()
[HttpGet]
[ValidateAntiforgeryToken]
public class SafeModel : PageModel
In case you can't use a global action filter, add the
AutoValidateAntiforgeryToken attribute to your controller classes or razor page
models:
[AutoValidateAntiforgeryToken]
public class UserController
[AutoValidateAntiforgeryToken]
public class SafeModel : PageModel
##### Using .Net Core or .NET Framework with AJAX
You will need to attach the anti-forgery token to AJAX requests.
If you are using jQuery in an ASP.NET Core MVC view this can be achieved using
this snippet:
@inject  Microsoft.AspNetCore.Antiforgery.IAntiforgery antiforgeryProvider
$.ajax(
{
    type: "POST",
    url: '@Url.Action("Action", "Controller")',
    contentType: "application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8",
    data: {
        id: id,
        '__RequestVerificationToken': '@antiforgeryProvider.GetAndStoreTokens
(this.Context).RequestToken'
    }
})
If you are using the .NET Framework, you can find some code snippets here.
More information can be found in the Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention
Cheat_Sheet.
### A06 Vulnerable and Outdated Components
DO: Keep the .NET framework updated with the latest patches
DO: Keep your NuGet packages up to date
DO: Run the OWASP_Dependency_Checker against your application as part of your
build process and act on any high or critical level vulnerabilities.
DO: Include SCA (software composition analysis) tools in your CI/CD pipeline to
ensure that any new vulnerabilities in your dependencies are detected and acted
upon.
### A07 Identification and Authentication Failures
DO: Use ASP.NET_Core_Identity. ASP.NET Core Identity framework is well
configured by default, where it uses secure password hashes and an individual
salt. Identity uses the PBKDF2 hashing function for passwords, and generates a
random salt per user.
DO: Set secure password policy
e.g ASP.NET Core Identity
//Startup.cs
services.Configure<IdentityOptions>(options =>
{
 // Password settings
 options.Password.RequireDigit = true;
 options.Password.RequiredLength = 8;
 options.Password.RequireNonAlphanumeric = true;
 options.Password.RequireUppercase = true;
 options.Password.RequireLowercase = true;
 options.Password.RequiredUniqueChars = 6;

 options.Lockout.DefaultLockoutTimeSpan = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(30);
 options.Lockout.MaxFailedAccessAttempts = 3;

 options.SignIn.RequireConfirmedEmail = true;

 options.User.RequireUniqueEmail = true;
});
DO: Set a cookie policy
e.g
//Startup.cs
services.ConfigureApplicationCookie(options =>
{
 options.Cookie.HttpOnly = true;
 options.ExpireTimeSpan = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(60);
 // See the discussion in A01 for trade-offs on using sliding expiration.
 options.SlidingExpiration = false;
});
### A08 Software and Data Integrity Failures
DO: Digitally sign assemblies and executable files
DO: Use Nuget package signing
DO: Review code and configuration changes to avoid malicious code or
dependencies being introduced
DO NOT: Send unsigned or unencrypted serialized objects over the network
DO: Perform integrity checks or validate digital signatures on serialized
objects received from the network
DO NOT: Use the BinaryFormatter type which is dangerous and not recommended for
data processing. .NET offers several in-box serializers that can handle
untrusted data safely:
    * XmlSerializer and DataContractSerializer to serialize object graphs into
      and from XML. Do not
      confuse DataContractSerializer with NetDataContractSerializer.
    * BinaryReader and BinaryWriter for reading and writing primitive data
      types (such as Int32, Double, Boolean, and String) in binary format.
    * The System.Text.Json APIs to serialize object graphs into JSON.
### A09 Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
DO: Ensure all login, access control, and server-side input validation failures
are logged with sufficient user context to identify suspicious or malicious
accounts.
DO: Establish effective monitoring and alerting so suspicious activities are
detected and responded to in a timely fashion.
DO NOT: Log generic error messages such as: csharp Log.Error("Error was
thrown");. Instead, log the stack trace, error message and user ID who caused
the error.
DO NOT: Log sensitive data such as user's passwords.
#### Logging
What logs to collect and more information about logging can be found in the
Logging_Cheat_Sheet.
.NET Core comes with a LoggerFactory, which is in Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.
More information about ILogger can be found here.
Here's how to log all errors from the Startup.cs, so that anytime an error is
thrown it will be logged:
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env)
{
    if (env.IsDevelopment())
    {
        _isDevelopment = true;
        app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
    }

    //Log all errors in the application
    app.UseExceptionHandler(errorApp =>
    {
        errorApp.Run(async context =>
        {
            var errorFeature = context.Features.Get<IExceptionHandlerFeature>
();
            var exception = errorFeature.Error;

            Log.Error(String.Format("Stacktrace of error:
{0}",exception.StackTrace.ToString()));
        });
    });

    app.UseAuthentication();
    app.UseMvc();
 }
}
E.g. injecting into the class constructor, which makes writing unit test
simpler. This is recommended if instances of the class will be created using
dependency injection (e.g. MVC controllers). The below example shows logging of
all unsuccessful login attempts.
public class AccountsController : Controller
{
        private ILogger _Logger;

        public AccountsController(ILogger logger)
        {
            _Logger = logger;
        }

        [HttpPost]
        [AllowAnonymous]
        [ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
        public async Task<IActionResult> Login(LoginViewModel model)
        {
            if (ModelState.IsValid)
            {
                var result = await _signInManager.PasswordSignInAsync
(model.Email, model.Password, model.RememberMe, lockoutOnFailure: false);
                if (result.Succeeded)
                {
                    //Log all successful log in attempts
                    Log.Information(String.Format("User: {0}, Successfully
Logged in", model.Email));
                    //Code for successful login
                    //...
                }
                else
                {
                    //Log all incorrect log in attempts
                    Log.Information(String.Format("User: {0}, Incorrect
Password", model.Email));
                }
             }
            ...
        }
#### Monitoring
Monitoring allow us to validate the performance and health of a running system
through key performance indicators.
In .NET a great option to add monitoring capabilities is Application_Insights.
More information about Logging and Monitoring can be found here.
### A10 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
DO: Validate and sanitize all user input before using it to make a request
DO: Use an allowlist of allowed protocols and domains
DO: Use IPAddress.TryParse() and Uri.CheckHostName() to ensure that IP
addresses and domain names are valid
DO NOT: Follow HTTP redirects
DO NOT: Forward raw HTTP responses to the user
For more information please see the Server-Side_Request_Forgery_Prevention
Cheat_Sheet.
### OWASP 2013 & 2017
Below are vulnerabilities that were included in the 2013 or 2017 OWASP Top 10
list that were not included in the 2021 list. These vulnerabilities are still
relevant but were not included in the 2021 list because they have become less
prevalent.
#### A04:2017 XML External Entities (XXE)
XXE attacks occur when an XML parse does not properly process user input that
contains external entity declarations in the doctype of an XML payload.
This_article discusses the most common XML Processing Options for .NET.
Please refer to the XXE_cheat_sheet for more detailed information on preventing
XXE and other XML Denial of Service attacks.
#### A07:2017 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
DO NOT: Trust any data the user sends you. Prefer allowlists (always safe) over
denylists.
You get encoding of all HTML content with MVC3. To properly encode all content
whether HTML, JavaScript, CSS, LDAP, etc., use the Microsoft AntiXSS library:
Install-Package AntiXSS
Then set in config:
<system.web>
<httpRuntime targetFramework="4.5"
enableVersionHeader="false"
encoderType="Microsoft.Security.Application.AntiXssEncoder, AntiXssLibrary"
maxRequestLength="4096" />
DO NOT: Use the [AllowHTML] attribute or helper class @Html.Raw unless you are
absolutely sure that the content you are writing to the browser is safe and has
been escaped properly.
DO: Enable a Content_Security_Policy. This will prevent your pages from
accessing assets they should not be able to access (e.g. malicious scripts):
<system.webServer>
    <httpProtocol>
        <customHeaders>
            <add name="Content-Security-Policy"
                value="default-src 'none'; style-src 'self'; img-src 'self';
                font-src 'self'; script-src 'self'" />
More information can be found in the Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat
Sheet.
#### A08:2017 Insecure Deserialization
DO NOT: Accept Serialized Objects from Untrusted Sources
DO: Validate User Input
Malicious users are able to use objects like cookies to insert malicious
information to change user roles. In some cases, hackers are able to elevate
their privileges to administrator rights by using a pre-existing or cached
password hash from a previous session.
DO: Prevent Deserialization of Domain Objects
DO: Run the Deserialization Code with Limited Access Permissions If a
deserialized hostile object tries to initiate a system process or access a
resource within the server or the host's OS, it will be denied access and a
permission flag will be raised so that a system administrator is made aware of
any anomalous activity on the server.
More information about Insecure Deserialization can be found in the
Deserialization_Cheat_Sheet.
#### A10:2013 Unvalidated redirects and forwards
A protection against this was introduced in MVC 3 template. Here is the code:
public async Task<ActionResult> LogOn(LogOnViewModel model, string returnUrl)
{
    if (ModelState.IsValid)
    {
        var logonResult = await _userManager.TryLogOnAsync
(model.UserName, model.Password);
        if (logonResult.Success)
        {
            await _userManager.LogOnAsync
(logonResult.UserName, model.RememberMe);  
            return RedirectToLocal(returnUrl);
...
private ActionResult RedirectToLocal(string returnUrl)
{
    if (Url.IsLocalUrl(returnUrl))
    {
        return Redirect(returnUrl);
    }
    else
    {
        return RedirectToAction("Landing", "Account");
    }
}
### Other advice
    * Protect against Clickjacking and Man-in-the-Middle attack from capturing
      an initial Non-TLS request: Set the X-Frame-Options and Strict-Transport-
      Security (HSTS) headers. Full details here
    * Protect against a man-in-the-middle attack for a user who has never been
      to your site before. Register for HSTS_preload
    * Maintain security testing and analysis on Web API services. They are
      hidden inside MVC sites, and are public parts of a site that will be
      found by an attacker. All of the MVC guidance and much of the WCF
      guidance applies to Web API as well.
    * Also see the Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards_Cheat_Sheet.

sample MVC5 application with an enhanced security baseline go to Security
Essentials_Baseline_project.
## Guidance for specific topics
This section contains guidance for specific topics in .NET.
### Configuration and Deployment
    * Lock down config files.
          o Remove all aspects of configuration that are not in use.
          o Do not store secrets in source-controlled config files (web.config,
            appsettings.json). Keep secrets out of the configuration file
            entirely.
                # Modern .NET (Core / 6+ / 8+): use User_Secrets for
                  development and a managed secret store (Azure Key Vault, AWS
                  Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault) accessed via Managed
                  Identity / Workload Identity for production.
                # Legacy .NET Framework (4.7.1+): use Configuration_Builders
                  (e.g. Microsoft.Configuration.ConfigurationBuilders.Azure,
                  ...Environment) to inject secrets at runtime from a secret
                  store or environment variables, so they never appear in
                  web.config.
                # Only as a last resort — for legacy applications that cannot
                  be modified — encrypt sensitive web.config sections using
                  aspnet_regiis -pe (command_line_help). Note that this only
                  protects the file at rest on the server; the application
                  still loads the plaintext into memory.
    * For ClickOnce applications, the .NET Framework should be upgraded to use
      the latest version to ensure support of TLS 1.2 or later.
### Data Access
    * Use Parameterized_SQL commands for all data access, without exception.
    * Do not use SqlCommand with a string parameter made up of a concatenated
      SQL_String.
    * List allowable values coming from the user. Use enums, TryParse or lookup
      values to assure that the data coming from the user is as expected.
          o Enums are still vulnerable to unexpected values because .NET only
            validates a successful cast to the underlying data type, integer by
            default. Enum.IsDefined can validate whether the input value is
            valid within the list of defined constants.
    * Apply the principle of least privilege when setting up the Database User
      in your database of choice. The database user should only be able to
      access items that make sense for the use case.
    * Use of Entity_Framework is a very effective SQL_injection prevention
      mechanism. Remember that building your own ad hoc queries in Entity
      Framework is just as susceptible to SQLi as a plain SQL query.
    * When using SQL Server, prefer integrated_authentication over SQL
      authentication.
    * Use Always_Encrypted where possible for sensitive data (SQL Server 2016+
      and Azure SQL)
## ASP NET Web Forms Guidance
ASP.NET Web Forms is the original browser-based application development API for
the .NET Framework, and is still the most common enterprise platform for web
application development.
    * Always use HTTPS.
    * Enable requireSSL on cookies and form elements and HttpOnly on cookies in
      the web.config.
    * Implement customErrors.
    * Make sure tracing is turned off.
    * While ViewState isn't always appropriate for web development, using it
      can provide CSRF mitigation. To make the ViewState protect against CSRF
      attacks you need to set the ViewStateUserKey:
protected override OnInit(EventArgs e) {
    base.OnInit(e);
    ViewStateUserKey = Session.SessionID;
}
If you don't use Viewstate, then look to the default main page of the ASP.NET
Web Forms default template for a manual anti-CSRF token using a double-submit
cookie.
private const string AntiXsrfTokenKey = "__AntiXsrfToken";
private const string AntiXsrfUserNameKey = "__AntiXsrfUserName";
private string _antiXsrfTokenValue;
protected void Page_Init(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    // The code below helps to protect against XSRF attacks
    var requestCookie = Request.Cookies[AntiXsrfTokenKey];
    Guid requestCookieGuidValue;
    if (requestCookie != null && Guid.TryParse
(requestCookie.Value, out requestCookieGuidValue))
    {
       // Use the Anti-XSRF token from the cookie
       _antiXsrfTokenValue = requestCookie.Value;
       Page.ViewStateUserKey = _antiXsrfTokenValue;
    }
    else
    {
       // Generate a new Anti-XSRF token and save to the cookie
       _antiXsrfTokenValue = Guid.NewGuid().ToString("N");
       Page.ViewStateUserKey = _antiXsrfTokenValue;
       var responseCookie = new HttpCookie(AntiXsrfTokenKey)
       {
          HttpOnly = true,
          Value = _antiXsrfTokenValue
       };
       if (FormsAuthentication.RequireSSL && Request.IsSecureConnection)
       {
          responseCookie.Secure = true;
       }
       Response.Cookies.Set(responseCookie);
    }
    Page.PreLoad += master_Page_PreLoad;
}
protected void master_Page_PreLoad(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    if (!IsPostBack)
    {
       // Set Anti-XSRF token
       ViewState[AntiXsrfTokenKey] = Page.ViewStateUserKey;
       ViewState
[AntiXsrfUserNameKey] = Context.User.Identity.Name ?? String.Empty;
    }
    else
    {
       // Validate the Anti-XSRF token
       if ((string)ViewState[AntiXsrfTokenKey] != _antiXsrfTokenValue ||
          (string)ViewState[AntiXsrfUserNameKey] != 
(Context.User.Identity.Name ?? String.Empty))
       {
          throw new InvalidOperationException("Validation of Anti-
XSRF token failed.");
       }
    }
}
    * Consider HSTS in IIS. See here for the procedure.
    * This is a recommended web.config setup that handles HSTS among other
      things.

         </rule>
       </outboundRules>
     </rewrite>
   </system.webServer>
 </configuration>
    * Remove the version header by adding the following line in Machine.config
      file:
<httpRuntime enableVersionHeader="false" />
    * Also remove the Server header using the HttpContext Class in your code.
HttpContext.Current.Response.Headers.Remove("Server");
### HTTP validation and encoding
    * Do not disable validateRequest in the web.config or the page setup. This
      value enables limited XSS protection in ASP.NET and should be left intact
      as it provides partial prevention of Cross Site Scripting. Complete
      request validation is recommended in addition to the built-in
      protections.
    * The 4.5 version of the .NET Frameworks includes the AntiXssEncoder
      library, which has a comprehensive input encoding library for the
      prevention of XSS. Use it.
    * List allowable values anytime user input is accepted.
    * Validate the format of URIs using Uri.IsWellFormedUriString.
### Forms authentication
    * Use cookies for persistence when possible. Cookieless auth will default
      to UseDeviceProfile.
    * Don't trust the URI of the request for persistence of the session or
      authorization. It can be easily faked.
    * Reduce the Forms Authentication timeout from the default of 20 minutes to
      the shortest period appropriate for your application. If
      slidingExpiration is used this timeout resets after each request, so
      active users won't be affected.
    * If HTTPS is not used, slidingExpiration should be disabled. Consider
      disabling slidingExpiration even with HTTPS.
    * Always implement proper access controls.
          o Compare user provided username with User.Identity.Name.
          o Check roles against User.Identity.IsInRole.
    * Use the ASP.NET_Membership_provider_and_role_provider, but review the
      password storage. The default storage hashes the password with a single
      iteration of SHA-1 which is rather weak. The ASP.NET MVC4 template uses
      ASP.NET_Identity instead of ASP.NET Membership, and ASP.NET Identity uses
      PBKDF2 by default which is better. Review the OWASP Password_Storage
      Cheat_Sheet for more information.
    * Explicitly authorize resource requests.
    * Leverage role based authorization using User.Identity.IsInRole.
## XAML Guidance
    * Work within the constraints of Internet Zone security for your
      application.
    * Use ClickOnce deployment. For enhanced permissions, use permission
      elevation at runtime or trusted application deployment at install time.
## Windows Forms Guidance
    * Use partial trust when possible. Partially trusted Windows applications
      reduce the attack surface of an application. Manage a list of what
      permissions your app must use, and what it may use, and then make the
      request for those permissions declaratively at runtime.
    * Use ClickOnce deployment. For enhanced permissions, use permission
      elevation at runtime or trusted application deployment at install time.
## WCF Guidance
    * Keep in mind that the only safe way to pass a request in RESTful services
      is via HTTP POST, with TLS enabled. Using HTTP GET necessitates putting
      the data in the URL (e.g. the query string) which is visible to the user
      and will be logged and stored in their browser history.
    * Avoid BasicHttpBinding. It has no default security configuration. Use
      WSHttpBinding instead.
    * Use at least two security modes for your binding. Message security
      includes security provisions in the headers. Transport security means use
      of SSL. TransportWithMessageCredential combines the two.
    * Test your WCF implementation with a fuzzer like ZAP.
