# Database Security Cheat Sheet
## Introduction
This cheat sheet provides guidance for securely configuring SQL databases such
as MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, and Microsoft SQL Server. It is designed
primarily for application developers and system administrators responsible for
managing or interacting with relational databases.
For application-layer injection defenses, see the SQL_Injection_Prevention
Cheat_Sheet. For guidance on non-relational systems (e.g., MongoDB, Redis,
Cassandra, DynamoDB), refer to the NoSQL_Security_Cheat_Sheet
## Protecting the Backend Database
The application's backend database should be isolated from other servers and
only connect with as few hosts as possible. This task will depend on the system
and network architecture. Consider these suggestions:
    * Disabling network (TCP) access and requiring all access is over a local
      socket file or named pipe.
    * Configuring the database to only bind on localhost.
    * Restricting access to the network port to specific hosts with firewall
      rules.
    * Placing the database server on a dedicated internal network segment that
      is isolated from the application server.
    * Protect any web-based management tools (e.g., phpMyAdmin, pgAdmin) with
      authentication, HTTPS, and network restrictions.
When an application is running on an untrusted system (such as a thick-client),
it should always connect to the backend through an API that can enforce
appropriate access control and restrictions. Direct connections should never be
made from a thick client to the backend database.
### Implementing Transport Layer Protection
Most database default configurations start with unencrypted network
connections, though some do encrypt the initial authentication (such as
Microsoft SQL Server). Even if the initial authentication is encrypted, the
rest of the traffic will be unencrypted and all kinds of sensitive information
will be sent across the network in clear text. The following steps should be
taken to prevent unencrypted traffic:
    * Configure the database to only allow encrypted connections.
    * Install a trusted digital certificate on the server.
    * The client application should connect using TLSv1.2+ with modern ciphers
      (e.g, AES-GCM or ChaCha20).
    * The client application should verify that the digital certificate is
      correct.
The Transport_Layer_Security_Cheat_Sheet contains further guidance on securely
configuring TLS.
## Configuring Secure Authentication
The database should always require authentication, including connections from
the local server. Database accounts should be:
    * Protected with strong and unique passwords.
    * Used by a single application or service.
    * Configured with the minimum permissions required as discussed in the
      permissions_section_below.
As with any system that has its own user accounts, the usual account management
processes should be followed, including:
    * Regular reviews of the accounts to ensure that they are still required.
    * Regular reviews of permissions.
    * Removing user accounts when an application is decommissioned.
    * Changing the passwords when staff leave, or there is reason to believe
      that they may have been compromised.
For Microsoft SQL Server, consider the use of Windows_or_Integrated-
Authentication, which uses existing Windows accounts rather than SQL Server
accounts. This also removes the requirement to store credentials in the
application, as it will connect using the credentials of the Windows user it is
running under. The Windows_Native_Authentication_Plugins provides similar
functionality for MySQL.
### Storing Database Credentials Securely
Database credentials should never be stored in the application source code,
especially if they are unencrypted. Instead, they should be stored in a
configuration file that:
    * Is outside of the web root.
    * Has appropriate permissions so that it can only be read by the required
      user(s).
    * Is not checked into source code repositories.
Where possible, these credentials should also be encrypted or otherwise
protected using built-in functionality, such as the web.config encryption
available in ASP.NET.
## Creating Secure Permissions
When developers are assigning permissions to database user accounts, they
should employ the principle of least privilege (i.e, the accounts should only
have the minimal permissions required for the application to function). This
principle can be applied at a number of increasingly granular levels depending
on the functionality available in the database. You can do the following in all
environments:
    * Do not use the built-in root, sa or SYS accounts.
    * Do not grant the account administrative rights over the database
      instance.
    * Make sure the account can only connect from allowed hosts. This would
      often be localhost or the address of the application server.
    * The account should only access the specific databases it needs.
      Development, UAT and Production environments should all use separate
      databases and accounts.
    * Only grant the required permissions on the databases. Most applications
      would only need SELECT, UPDATE and DELETE permissions. The account should
      not be the owner of the database as this can lead to privilege escalation
      vulnerabilities.
    * Avoid using database links or linked servers. Where they are required,
      use an account that has been granted access to only the minimum
      databases, tables, and system privileges required.
Most security-critical applications, apply permissions at more granular levels,
including:
    * Table-level permissions.
    * Column-level permissions.
    * Row-level permissions
    * Blocking access to the underlying tables, and requiring all access
      through restricted views.
## Database Configuration and Hardening
The database server's underlying operating system should be hardened by basing
it on a secure baseline such as the CIS_Benchmarks or the Microsoft_Security
Baselines.
The database application should also be properly configured and hardened. The
following principles should apply to any database application and platform:
    * Install any required security updates and patches.
    * Configure the database services to run under a low privileged user
      account.
    * Remove any default accounts and databases.
    * Store transaction_logs on a separate disk to the main database files.
    * Configure a regular backup of the database. Ensure that the backups are
      protected with appropriate permissions, and ideally encrypted.
The following sections give some further recommendations for specific database
software, in addition to the more general recommendations given above.
### Hardening a Microsoft SQL Server
    * Disable xp_cmdshell, xp_dirtree and other stored procedures that are not
      required.
    * Disable Common Language Runtime (CLR) execution.
    * Disable the SQL Browser service.
    * Disable Mixed_Mode_Authentication unless it is required.
    * Ensure that the sample Northwind_and_AdventureWorks_databases have been
      removed.
    * See Microsoft's articles on securing_SQL_Server.
### Hardening a MySQL or a MariaDB Server
    * Run the mysql_secure_installation script to remove the default databases
      and accounts.
    * Disable the FILE privilege for all users to prevent them reading or
      writing files.
    * See the Oracle_MySQL and MariaDB hardening guides.
### Hardening a PostgreSQL Server
    * See the PostgreSQL_Server_Setup_and_Operation_documentation and the older
      Security_documentation.
### MongoDB
    * See the NoSQL_Security_Cheat_Sheet for general guidance on securing NoSQL
      databases.
    * See the MongoDB_security_checklist.
### Redis
    * See the Redis_security_guide.
